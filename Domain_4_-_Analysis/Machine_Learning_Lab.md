### Machine Learning Lab

* Data comes from UC Irvine repo [Adult Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult)

* Dude converted it to CSV, added column headers, and target column (1 = > 50k, 0 = < 50k) - [data is here](https://github.com/sko71/aws-bigdata-specialty/blob/master/Domain%204/adult_census_data.csv)

* Not much new information here thatâ€™s not covered in other lectures, but be sure to do it to get the hands-on experience with it

* Also recommended to do the AWS lab on Machine Learning, which uses a marketing offer dataset [http://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/dg/tutorial.html](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/dg/tutorial.html)
