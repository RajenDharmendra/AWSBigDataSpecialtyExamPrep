### Table Design - Sort Keys

* Data stored on disk according to sort key - query optimizer uses sort key to do query plans

* Closest thing to index (not a direct replacement)

* Not all tables need a sort key

* Block size is 1MB default - you don’t need to do anything

* Because block size is larger, I/O is reduced - this helps with performance

* **Zone Maps** - track min and max values for each block

* Load data in sort order - if not, sort key doesn’t really perform the way you thought it would - will read all blocks loaded before where your data is

    * have to run VACUUM command

* **Compound Sort Key** - contains all columns in sort key

    * Default sort type - beneficial when used with:

        * Joins

        * Order by, group by

        * Partition by and order by window functions

    * When you add large amounts of data to a table w/ a compound sort key, over time you have an unsorted region - large parts of table unsorted 

        * have to run a VACUUM operation

        * Then an ANALYZE operation

    * Table sorted by columns listed in sort key order

    * Poor performance if query does not include the primary sort column (first column in sortkey definition)

* **Interleaved Sort Key** - give equal weight to all columns in sort key

    * Useful when you’ve got multiple queries w/ different filters

    * Great when you need to have queries filtering on one or more sort key columns in the WHERE clause

    * Data loading and VACUUM will be slower

    * Most useful on very large tables only - 100 M + rows

    * NOT good for loading data in sort order (they don't preserve this order)

* Can have tables w/ single sort key

Guidance on choosing sort keys

* TIMESTAMP column for recent data

* Columns used in BETWEEN conditions or equality operators

* Columns used in a join

* Same column can be used as SORT key and DISTRIBUTION key - can work very well

* Remember to use sort keys and distribution styles! - Very common cause of performance problems
