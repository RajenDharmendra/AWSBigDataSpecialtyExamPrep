## List of Services Covered

This is a list of all the services covered in the A Cloud Guru study lectures.  The *Importance* column speaks to my own *perceived* importance relative to the domain.  My criteria:

* **High** - If the domain didn't have much in it, all items were marked as High
* **Medium** - If this item was covered lightly or if there was explicit mention that there weren't many questions on this item, it was marked as Medium
* **Low** - If the gist of the video was "Know what it is and when to use it," it was marked as Low 

When in doubt, an item was marked High
