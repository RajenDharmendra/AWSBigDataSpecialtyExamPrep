* Steps for Vault Lock

    * Initial Vault Lock

        * Attaches Vault Lock policy to vault

        * Lock is then set to an InProgress state, lock ID is returned

        * You then have 24 hours to validate the lock, or it expires

    * Complete Vault Lock

        * Now goes from InProgress state â†’ Locked state (immutable)

**For the exam, know:**

* Vault lock controls - time-based retention, "undeleteable" or both

* Implement control using IAM policies
